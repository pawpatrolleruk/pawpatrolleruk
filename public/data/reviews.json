    "review_text": "Amazing Pet Sitter! We couldn't be happier with the daycare service Kristina provided for our dogs, Kai and Finn. It was clear from the start that she is a true animal lover, and our dogs absolutely adored her. They felt comfortable and happy in her care, which gave us great peace of mind. Kristina went above and beyond in every way. She sent us regular updates throughout the day and was incredibly responsive to any questions or messages. She took stunning photos and videos of the dogs on walks and relaxing at home, which she shared with us afterward. It was such a lovely touch to see them so content! She even kept detailed notes about their tasks, routines, and behaviors during the day, so we had a full picture when we returned. Her attention to detail and care really stood out. Kristina is not only friendly and professional but also genuinely dedicated to providing the best care possible. We highly recommend her to anyone looking for a reliable and caring pet sitter. We will definitely be booking her again!",

Finding someone who'll love them that much is tough, but we trust Paw_Patroller_UK completely. Our pets are always happy and healthy when we get back. They're responsible, genuinely care, and clearly enjoy the animals.",

When she told me that she would start a business with dogs and other animals I was thrilled. I highly recommend if you wish for your pet to be in loving, caring and knowledgeable hands. She understands how important it is for your pet to be cared for and for you to be kept in contact with to reassure you because she has taken care of so many of my animals, from puppies to huge draught horses! She currently takes care of my most important member of my four-legged family, Blake my older French Bulldog. He adores her and her daughter. Have faith your pet will be in good hands. 10 stars +++",

Sphynxes require special attention, and you went above and beyond to ensure Gypsy was happy, healthy, and loved. Thank you for daily updates, photos, and messages, which gave me so much peace of mind knowing my little one was in such great hands. When I returned, Gypsy was relaxed, well-fed, and clearly well cared for. The house was spotless, and it was clear you treated Gypsy like your own. If you're looking for a trustworthy and loving pet sitter, I highly recommend them. I will definitely be calling them again for the next trip!",
